The bayesian optimization task was solved using Gaussian Process Regressors with Matern kernels as explained in the Task description. For the acquisition function we chose the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition function. As the mapping v has a constant mean of 1.5 we included it by taking the bias into account when calculating UCB * P(safe). The first couple (5) samples were chosen at random (pure exploration) and then use optimize_acquisition_function with Beta=3. The final solution was chosen by setting Beta=0 giving pure exploitation in get_solution.
