Task 4 was solved by implementing the algorithm as described in task description and the GAE's paper except trust region updates. This gave us a score that was able to pass the baseline. We then impvored the score significantly by changing the learning rates for the actor. Specificly we introduced a decaying learning rate for the actor. The learning rate starts of fairly large at 5e-2 for the first 15 epochs, reducing to 5e-3 after 30 epochs and made really small (5e-4) for the final epochs.
